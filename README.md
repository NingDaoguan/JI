# Graduate courses at UM-SJTU

## VM432 Combustion

> Introduction to combustion processes; combustion thermodynamics, reaction kinetics and combustion transport. Chain reactions, ignition, quenching, and flammability limits, detonations, deflagrations, and flame stability. Introduction to turbulent premixed combustion. Applications in IC engines, furnaces, gas turbines, and rocket engines.

## VM520 Advanced Fluid Mechanics

> *Fundamental mechanics of fluids, I. G. Currie, 2003*

## VM557 Methods of Applied Mathematics II

> The course consists of three parts, each dealing with certain mathematical techniques useful for solving differential equations. Examples from mechanical as well as electrical engineering will be used throughout.

## VM 505 Finite Element Methods

> This course focuses on the development of finite element methods for linear, static and dynamic structural analysis. The basic tools of the finite element method are described and the formulation of various structural elements is discussed.
